# Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Surface-Defect-Detection-For-Fun
A Pytorch implementation of ‚ÄùSegmentation-Based Deep-Learning Approach for Surface-Defect Detection . 
Just for learning

Do not test the accuracy, the code can work.

Fisrt, training segment net
python segment_train.py

Second, training decision net
python decision_train.py

Sorry for no test
